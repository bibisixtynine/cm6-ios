# Codemirror6

## project's object :

This code demonstrate a Codemirror6 with Safari iOS/iPadOS text selection bug :

1) Try to select the 12345678901 number by double-tapping on it : the selection works, but the options menu 'cut-copy-find...' doesn't appear.

2) Then delete (line 1) or (line 2) or just (the last '1' digit of the number), or add '2345' next to '12345678901', touble-tap again : this time it's OK and the options menu is there.

## what's in the project :

src/index.js : codemirror init is there, this file will be 'compressed' to :

build/index.js : generated by esbuild

package.json : esbuild config

build/index.html : the html part... project starts here
